# Loading-Helper
A helper for loading files into hot folders based on codes.

# Instructions
The loader expects that the file has a product code in it somewhere. 

You'll have to directly edit output.py to include the product codes you want, the output directory, and the hot folders. I plan to implement a way to do this a bit easier in the future.

Once the program loads in, you'll be able to choose the product code at the top. Once the files load in, you can choose to either select all of them using a built in button, or just a few by clicking them manually.
On clicking send, the files get copied to the hot folders, and the files also get shared with the other window showing what jobs have been sent while it's been open. 
You can resend jobs that have been sent by using the "Jobs Running" window. It allows you to select the jobs and resend them.
